This project is a simple Facebook clone. Users can signup with an optional profile picture, login, make posts (with images), like/dislike and comment on posts, search all posts for specific content, and view their own profile page.\
This app is deployed on [Heroku](https://whispering-woodland-40745.herokuapp.com/).

In this project we learned and implemented the following techniques:

- Introduction to Ruby on Rails & Active Record
- Agile Methology for user stories & domain modeling
- Feature and Unit testing
- GET / POST requests - defining routes
- Creating Tickets & using Trello
- Run stand-ups and retrospectives
- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
